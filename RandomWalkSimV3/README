### INTRODUCTION ###
Version 3 of the random walk simulator consists of multiple parts:
* Random Walk Simulator or other Mobility Simulator
* Data Importer
* Data Analyzer
* Data Visualizer

The Random Walk Simulator included performs a simple random walk 
using a gaussian distribution to determine location. The simulator only 
outputs latitudes and longitudes of base stations and mobile agents. The 
simulator can simulator multiple agents using multiple "threads" 
(process is forked in python). 

The Data Importer imports the various mobility simulator data formats 
into a standard SQLITE Database

The Data Analyzer looks at the information in the SQL Lite database and 
determines what agents are within range of other agents. It will also 
export statistics based on this data.

The Data Visualizer will visualize the data output by the Data Analyzer 
using Google Earth and KML.


### FILE FORMATS ###

Random Walk Simulator:
This simulator outputs a comma delimited file without colum headings. 
The colum headings are the following:
entity_id,device_type,x_loc,y_loc,encryption,round

* entity_id = Unique identifier of the enetity. If it starts with a 'p' 
	it's a mobile agent. If it starts with a 'b' It's a base 
	station.  
* device_type = This will be used if different devices are chosen
* x_loc = The x_location of the device.
* y_loc = the y_location of the device.
* encryption = Does the device use an encrypted key to connect? This is
	currently only being considered for wireless base stations.
* round = The round number for the current position. If the round 
	number is X, then the device never moves.
